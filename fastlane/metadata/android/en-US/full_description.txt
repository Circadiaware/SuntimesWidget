<p>Displays sunlight and moonlight times. Features an app and widget collection.</p>

<p>Displays sunrise and sunset, twilight (civil / nautical / astronomical), blue and golden hour, the solstices and equinoxes, moonrise and moonset, moon phases and illumination.</p>

<p>The times reported by this app are approximate. The app doesn't require network connectivity, GPS is optional.</p>

The app benefits from the following permissions:
<ul>
<li><small><u>ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION</u></small> is used to obtain the current position (latitude, longitude, altitude).</li>
<li><small><u>SET_ALARM</u></small> is used to schedule alarms using the AlarmClock app.</li>
<li><small><u>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</u></small> is used to backup data to file (places, themes, etc) (api<=18 only).</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: The "Calendar Integration" and permissions added in v0.9.0 have been removed in v0.10.0. This feature is now available as a separate add-on app; <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.forrestguice.suntimescalendars">Suntimes Calendars</a>.</p>
